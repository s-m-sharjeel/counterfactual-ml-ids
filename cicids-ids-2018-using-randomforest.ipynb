    "* The model was trained using **100** decision trees with a maximum depth of **3** and default values for *min_samples_split* and *min_samples_leaf*.\n",
    "* The Random Forest model generalized well and showed strong predictive performance.\n",
    "* The Mean Squared Error (MSE) on validation data was **0.01**, indicating that the model made very few incorrect predictions.\n",
    "* The model achieved an impressive *R²* Score of **0.97**, which suggests that **97%** of the variability in the data is explained by the model.\n",
    "* Therefore, the Random Forest Classifier proved to be highly effective for this classification task, with reliable performance and strong generalization capability."
